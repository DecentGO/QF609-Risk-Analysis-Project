# Value at Risk (VaR)

Suppose that we have the following portfolio of positions as of 30/10/2023:
(a) a payer (i.e. pay ffxed leg and receive ffoat leg) SOFR swap with the following contract
parameters:

* Notional: $100 million

* Starting Date: 30/10/2023

* Maturity: 10Y

* Strike: 4.2%

* FloatLeg Frequency: Annual

* FixedLeg Frequency: Annual
(b) $1 million in each of the four stocks: AAPL, MSFT, F (Ford Motor) and BAC (Bank of
America)
An Excel workbook consisting of one-year of historical data (31/10/2022 - 30/10/2024) of
the SOFR curve and the share prices of the four stocks above has been provided. Using the
data, calculate the 1-day 95% VaR for the portfolio as of 30/10/2024 using each of the following
models:
(a) Parametric VaR Model
(b) Monte Carlo VaR Model (under both full revaluation and risk-based approaches)
(c) Historical VaR Model (under both full revaluation and risk-based approaches)
For Monte Carlo VaR, you may assume the risk factor changes are normally distributed.
